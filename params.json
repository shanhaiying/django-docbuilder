What if you don't want to install the whole\r\nHaskell stack? What if you want to share the compilation process with non\r\ntechnical colleges?\r\n\r\nAfter many unsuccessful researches I was unable to find the simple tool I was\r\nlooking for. As I said, many tools exists to transform reStructuredText into\r\nLaTeX, but there are for most painful to install.\r\n\r\nI have decided to build a tool that is simple to install, that can be run remotely,\r\nwhere I can easily define the resulting template and where the sources are\r\npulled from a git repository.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\nTo run the app, you need `docutils` and `django` python package (pip FTW). \r\n\r\nIn addition, the `pdflatex` and `git` programme should be installed on the system.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical choices\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nAs I was unable to find a working python Markdown to LaTeX parser, I switched\r\nto reStructuredText which is quite the same think but have a great support\r\nthanks the Sphinx engine.\r\nIf you know a good Markdown parser, let me know ;)\r\n\r\nThe default helper is intended to work with Django, but any other web framework\r\ncan be used, a command line interface or what ever you want.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nAs usual, remember to add `docbuilder` to your django module list.\r\n\r\nYou will need an already cloned git repository, configured in `local_settings.py`.\r\nCheckout other settings.\r\n\r\nSome generic urls are provided in `urls.py`.\r\n\r\nDocuments and template","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
