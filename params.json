  "body": "Automatically build your git based documentation written in reStructuredText\r\ninto LaTeX through you Django app.\r\n\r\nMotivations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nMost of the time when writing documentation I don't need all the LaTeX complex\r\nthings, just the gorgeous rendering.\r\n\r\nTo hide this unnecessary complexity, I decided to use a simpler language like\r\nreStructuredText (at the beginning it was Markdown), and then transform it to LaTeX.\r\n\r\nMany tools already exists to do so, like\r\n[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) but what if you want to split your\r\ndocumentation into multiple files? What if you don't want to install the whole\r\nHaskell stack? What if you want to share the compilation process with non\r\ntechnical colleges?\r\n\r\nAfter many unsuccessful researches I was unable to find the simple tool I was\r\nlooking for. As I said, many tools exists to transform reStructuredText into\r\nLaTeX, but there are for most painful to install.\r\n\r\nI have decided to build a tool that is simple to install, that can be run remotely,\r\nwhere I can easily define the resulting template and where the sources are\r\npulled from a git repository.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\nTo run the app, you need `docutils` and `django` python package (pip FTW). \r\n\r\nIn addition, the `pdflatex` and `git` programme should be installed on the system.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical choices\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nAs I was unable to find a working python Markdown to LaTeX parser, I switched\r\nto reStructuredText which is quite the same think but have a great support\r\nthanks the Sphinx engine.\r\nIf you know a good Markdown parser, let me know ;)\r\n\r\nThe default helper is intended to work with Django, but any other web framework\r\ncan be used, a command line interface or what ever you want.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nAs usual, remember to add `docbuilder` to your django module list.\r\n\r\nYou will need an already cloned git repository, configured in `local_settings.py`.\r\nCheckout other settings.\r\n\r\nSome generic urls are provided in `urls.py`.\r\n\r\nDocuments and template\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nThree types of Documents can be used:\r\n\r\n * Articles: a title and multiple subtitles / paragraphs.\r\n * Reports: multiple titles with subtitles and paragraphs.\r\n * Slides: a beamer presentation\r\n\r\nThe build document can be either a document or a repository. In this case, all\r\nthe file in it are merged alphabetically.\r\n\r\n### Write an article\r\n\r\nAn article looks like that:\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\nMy article title\r\n================\r\n\r\nA subtitle\r\n----------\r\n\r\nBlabla\r\n\r\nAnother subtitle\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nBlabla...\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\nThe simplest template you can defined to build your article:\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\n\\documentclass{article}\r\n\r\n\\title{$title}\r\n\\date{\\today}\r\n\r\n\\begin{document}\r\n\\maketitle\r\n\r\n$body\r\n\\end{document}\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\n### Writing a report\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\nTitle 1\r\n=======\r\n\r\nTitle 1.1\r\n---------\r\n\r\nBlabla\r\n\r\nTitle 1.2\r\n---------\r\n\r\nBlabla\r\n\r\nTitle 2\r\n=======\r\n\r\nBlabla\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\n\\documentclass{report}\r\n\r\n\\title{THETITLE}\r\n\\date{\\today}\r\n\r\n\\begin{document}\r\n\\maketitle\r\n\r\n$body\r\n\\end{document}\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\nYou noticed that the title variable changed. This new variable is deduced from\r\nthe filename or directory (camel case is transformed: TechnicalNote becomes Technical Note).\r\n\r\nYou can also set dynamically the title with a title query string like\r\n`?title=Hello` or hard code it to the view via the title parameter \r\n\r\n### Write a presentation\r\n\r\nThe structure of a presentation is the same as the article. The main article\r\nwill represent the presentation title.\r\n\r\nEach subtitle will becomes the slide title and the content between those each slide contents.\r\n\r\nA minimalistic beamer template looks like:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\\documentclass{beamer}\r\n\r\n\\title{$title}\r\n\\author{Myself}\r\n\\date{\\today}\r\n\r\n\\begin{document}\r\n\\begin{frame}[t,plain]\r\n \\titlepage\r\n $body\r\n\\end{frame}\r\n\\end{document}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n\r\nInterested to use it?\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nBug reports, feature/pull request, comments, suggestions welcome!\r\n",
